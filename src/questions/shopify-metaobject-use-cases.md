### Explanation

Metaobjects serve a different purpose than metafields in Shopify:

1. Metaobjects allow you to create reusable groups of fields (definitions) that can be referenced across multiple resources
2. They are ideal for structured, repeatable content like:
   - Product specifications
   - Store locations
   - Team members
   - FAQ entries
3. Unlike metafields which are directly attached to resources (products, collections, etc.), metaobjects are standalone entities that can be referenced by multiple resources
4. They help maintain consistency in your data structure across your store
