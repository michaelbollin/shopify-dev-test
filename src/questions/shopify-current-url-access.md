### Explanation

To get the current page path:

```liquid
{{ request.path }}  // Returns the path portion of the URL
```

Key points:
- `request.path` returns the path portion of the URL
- `shop.url` returns the full URL of the store
- Available globally
- Useful for conditional logic

Example:
```liquid
{% if request.path contains '/products/' %}

{% endif %}
```
