### Explanation

It is not possible to validate discount codes before checkout in Shopify's frontend. This is a security feature to prevent enumeration of valid discount codes.

Available options for handling discount codes:

1. Customers can enter discount codes during checkout
2. Discount codes can be applied via URL parameters
3. Store owners can create automatic discounts that don't require codes

The `cart.discount_applications` Liquid variable only shows already-applied discounts (including both automatic and code-based discounts), and the price_rules endpoint is part of the Admin API which should not be exposed to the frontend.
