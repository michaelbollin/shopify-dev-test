  - Can be dynamically added/reordered on pages
  - Have their own schema configuration block
  - Can include settings like text fields, images, colors
  - Commonly used for major page components
  - Located in sections/ directory

- Snippets:
  - Simple reusable code blocks without customization settings
  - Cannot be customized through theme editor
  - Used for repeatable HTML/Liquid code
  - Help maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
  - Located in snippets/ directory
  - Often used for small components like product cards or form fields
