### Explanation

The Shopify CLI development server runs on port 9292 by default:

```bash
shopify theme dev
# Server running at: http://127.0.0.1:9292
```

Technical details:
- Default port: 9292
- Can be changed using --port flag if needed
- Local development server address: http://127.0.0.1:9292
- localhost:9292 also works
- Port must be free or command will fail
