### Explanation

When you run `shopify theme dev`, Shopify CLI:
- Creates a development theme in your store
- Syncs your local files to this development theme
- Hot-reloads changes as you work
- Does not affect your live/published theme

Key points:
- Development theme is temporary
- Safe to experiment without affecting live site
