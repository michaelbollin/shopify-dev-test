### Explanation

In Shopify, there's an important distinction between a customer and a customer account:

```liquid
{% if customer %}
  {% if customer.has_account %}
    Welcome back to your account, {{ customer.first_name }}!
  {% else %}
    Completing checkout as guest
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

Key points:
- A customer can exist without having an account (guest checkout)
- `customer` object exists during checkout even for guests
- `customer.has_account` specifically checks if the email is tied to an account
- Common scenarios:
  - Guest checkout: `customer` exists, but `customer.has_account` is false
  - Account holder: both `customer` exists and `customer.has_account` is true
  - Not logged in: `customer` is null/false
- This distinction allows for guest checkout while still tracking order information
