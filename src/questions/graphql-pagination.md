### Quick Explanation

The query will fail because Shopify's GraphQL API has a limit of 250 items per request. To fetch more than 250 items:

1. Request with `first: 250` and include `pageInfo` and `cursor`:
```graphql
{
  products(first: 250) {
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. For next page, use the `endCursor` value:
```graphql
{
  products(first: 250, after: "endCursor-value-here") {
    # ... same fields as above
  }
}
```

Or use Bulk Operations for large datasets.
