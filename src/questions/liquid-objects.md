### Explanation

The `product.selected_variant` object is specifically tied to URL parameters:

- Only populated when `?variant=123456789` is present in the URL
- Returns `nil` if no variant parameter exists
- Not affected by JavaScript variant selection (would need page reload)
- Does not automatically select first variant
- Common usage: maintaining variant selection after page refresh

Example URL: `https://store.myshopify.com/products/t-shirt?variant=123456789`
