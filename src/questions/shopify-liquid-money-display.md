### Explanation

This question tests understanding of Shopify's money handling in Liquid, where prices are stored in cents.

Step by step analysis:
1. First expression:
   - `price = 1999` (represents $19.99 in cents)
   - `times: 0.1` â†’ 199.9 cents ($1.999)
   - `round` â†’ 200 cents ($2.00)
   - `money` â†’ "$2.00"

2. Second expression:
   - `price = 1999` (cents)
   - `money_without_trailing_zeros` â†’ "$19.99"

Money filter behavior:
- Values are stored in cents (1999 = $19.99)
- `money`: Always shows cents
- `money_without_trailing_zeros`: Shows cents if non-zero
- Both add currency symbol
- Both handle decimal placement automatically

Common misconceptions:
- Forgetting values are in cents
- Thinking `round` keeps decimals
- Not realizing math operations work on the cent values
- Thinking the first operation affects the second line
