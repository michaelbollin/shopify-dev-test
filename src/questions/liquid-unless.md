### Explanation

The `unless` tag is a negative conditional in Liquid:

```liquid
{% unless product.available %}
  This product is sold out
{% endunless %}

<!-- Same as -->
{% if product.available != true %}
  This product is sold out
{% endif %}
```

Key points:
- `unless` executes when condition is false
- Cleaner than using `if` with negative condition
- Cannot use `else if` with `unless`
- Can use `else`:
  ```liquid
  {% unless customer %}
    Please log in
  {% else %}
    Welcome back!
  {% endunless %}
  ```
- Best practices:
  - Use for simple negative conditions
  - Use `if` for complex logic
  - Keep blocks short and readable
