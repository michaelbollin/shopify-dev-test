### Explanation

The Shopify Storefront API is a GraphQL API.

Key points:
- Storefront API uses GraphQL for flexible, efficient queries
- Storefront API can use public or private access tokens:
  - Public tokens for client-side apps (limited access)
  - Private tokens for server-side apps
- GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data
