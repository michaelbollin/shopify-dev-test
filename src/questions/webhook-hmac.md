### Explanation

Shopify uses HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) signatures to verify webhook authenticity. Here's the secure implementation:

```typescript

app.post('/webhooks', express.text({ type: '*/*' }), async (req, res) => {
  const { valid, topic, domain } = await shopify.webhooks.validate({
    rawBody: req.body,  
    rawRequest: req,
    rawResponse: res,
  });

  if (!valid) {
    res.sendStatus(400);  // Invalid HMAC signature
    return;
  }

  // Safe to process webhook - signature verified
});
```

Key points:

- HMAC validation is the official Shopify security method
- Secret tokens can be compromised
- IP checking is unreliable (can be spoofed)
- OAuth tokens are for API calls, not webhooks
- Always validate before processing payload
