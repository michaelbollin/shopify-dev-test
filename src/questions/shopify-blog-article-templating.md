### Explanation

In Shopify themes, `templates/article.liquid` (or `templates/article.json` for Online Store 2.0) is responsible for displaying individual blog articles.

Key points:
- Shopify has built-in blogging capabilities out of the box
- `article.liquid`/`article.json` handles the layout for a single blog post
- This template has access to the `article` object containing the post's content
- `blog.liquid`, in contrast, displays the list/index of blog articles
- The template can be customized to match your store's design needs

Note: For Online Store 2.0 themes, you might use `templates/article.json` with sections to create a more modular and customizable article page.
