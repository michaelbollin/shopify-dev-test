  What's wrong with this counter implementation? ðŸ”¢

  ```liquid
  {% assign counter %}
  {% for product in collection.products %}
    {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %}
    <div class="grid-item grid-item--{{ counter }}">
      {{ product.title }}
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
  ```

  - id: "c"
    text: "Missing type casting"

### Explanation

The code has an issue with counter initialization. The line `{% assign counter %}` is incorrect syntax and will cause an error. In Liquid, the `assign` tag requires both a variable name and a value. Without a value assignment, the counter variable remains undefined and cannot be incremented.

The correct implementation would be to initialize the counter with a value:

```liquid
{% assign counter = 0 %}
{% for product in collection.products %}
  {% assign counter = counter | plus: 1 %}
  <div class="grid-item grid-item--{{ counter }}">
    {{ product.title }}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
```
