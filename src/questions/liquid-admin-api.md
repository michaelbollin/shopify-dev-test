### Explanation

While it is technically possible to call the Shopify REST Admin API from template JavaScript by including admin credentials or access tokens, this is a significant security risk that should never be done.

Key points:
- JavaScript in theme templates is client-side and visible to all users
- Including admin credentials in JavaScript would expose them to:
  - Anyone who views the page source
  - Browser developer tools
- Secure alternatives for client-side operations:
  - Use the Storefront API with public access tokens
  - Implement server-side endpoints with proper authentication
