### Explanation

To sort arrays in Liquid, use the `sort` filter:

```liquid
{% assign my_array = "zebra, yak, xylophone" | split: ", " %}
{{ my_array | sort | join: ", " }}
<!-- Output: xylophone, yak, zebra -->
```

Key points:
- `sort` works on arrays of strings or numbers
- Sorts in ascending order by default
