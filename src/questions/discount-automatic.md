### Explanation

When multiple percentage-based order discounts apply, each discount is calculated from the original subtotal:

```text
Example calculation:
Original subtotal: $350

Discount calculations:
‚Ä¢ 10% off order = $35 (calculated from $350)
‚Ä¢ 15% off order = $52.50 (calculated from $350)
Total discount = $87.50
```

Key points:
‚Ä¢ Each percentage discount uses the original subtotal as its base
‚Ä¢ Discounts are not calculated sequentially
