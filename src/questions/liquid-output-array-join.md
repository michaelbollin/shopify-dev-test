### Explanation

Let's break down how this code works:

1. First operation: `split: ", "`
   - Takes "apple, banana, orange"
   - Splits it into array: `["apple", "banana", "orange"]`

2. Second operation: `join: " and "`
   - Takes the array
   - Joins elements with " and " between them
   - Results in: "apple and banana and orange"

Key points:
- `split` filter creates an array from a string
- `join` filter combines array elements into a string
- The joining text can be any string
- Useful for creating readable lists in content
