### Explanation

Understanding Shopify theme assets structure:

Key points:
- Shopify does NOT support subfolders in the assets directory
- All files must be placed directly in the assets folder:
  - ‚ùå assets/fonts/custom-font.woff2
  - ‚úÖ assets/custom-font.woff2
- Common workarounds:
  - Use naming conventions (e.g., font-custom.woff2)
  - Use prefixes for organization (e.g., img-logo.png)
  - Document file organization in theme README
- This limitation applies to:
  - Font files
  - Images
  - CSS/JS files
  - Any other asset types
