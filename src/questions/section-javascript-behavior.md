### Explanation

The `{% javascript %}` tag in sections has specific behavior:

Key points:
- JavaScript from all sections is concatenated into a single file
- Gets injected through `content_for_header` Liquid object
- Loaded asynchronously with `defer` attribute
- Each section's code is wrapped in a self-executing anonymous function
- Variables are scoped within a closure
- Only injected once per section type (not per instance)

Example of how it's processed:
```javascript
// Original section code
{% javascript %}
  function toggleSection() {
    const section = document.querySelector('.my-section');
    section.classList.toggle('active');
  }
{% endjavascript %}

// Gets transformed into something like:
(function() {
  function toggleSection() {
    const section = document.querySelector('.my-section');
    section.classList.toggle('active');
  }
})();
```

Important notes:
- Each section can only have ONE `{% javascript %}` tag
- Multiple tags will result in an error
- For instance-specific JS, use data attributes
- Runtime errors won't affect other sections due to closure
