### Explanation

When using `<body class="page-{{ page.handle }}">` on the homepage, the output will be:

```html
<body class="page-">
```

This happens because:
- On the homepage, `page.handle` is empty
- The homepage is not a "page" object in Shopify
- Only the static "page-" prefix remains

Key points:
- Homepage is a special template, not a page
- To target homepage specifically, use `template.name` instead
- For homepage-specific styling, consider using `{% if template.name == 'index' %}`
