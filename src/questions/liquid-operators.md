### Explanation

The `contains` operator in Liquid is used to check for the presence of a substring inside a string or array.

Key points:
- Used in conditional statements like `if` and `unless`
- Case-sensitive comparison

- Example usage:
```liquid
{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %}
  This product's title contains the word Pack.
{% endif %}
```
