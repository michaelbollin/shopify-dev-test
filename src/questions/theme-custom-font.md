### Explanation

Custom font implementation in Shopify themes:

Key points:
- Custom fonts should be uploaded to the `assets` directory in your theme:
  - NOT in the Files section of Shopify admin
  - Files section is for general file storage (PDFs, documents, etc.)
  - Theme assets are specifically for theme-related files
- Implementation steps:
  - Upload font files to theme assets directory
  - Define @font-face in theme CSS
  - Reference fonts in stylesheet
- Best practices:
  - Use web-optimized formats (WOFF2, WOFF)
  - Include fallback fonts
  - Files section won't work for fonts as it's not properly integrated with theme assets
  - Theme assets ensure proper serving of font files with correct MIME types
