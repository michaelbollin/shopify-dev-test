### Explanation

When working with Shopify webhooks, it's important to understand their visibility in the admin dashboard:

Key points:
- Webhooks created through the Admin API are not visible in the Shopify admin dashboard
- This is by design and doesn't affect the webhook functionality
- To view API-created webhooks, you need to:
  - Use the Admin API to list webhooks
- Common scenarios:
  - Custom apps using API to manage webhooks
  - Third-party apps creating webhooks programmatically
  - Automated webhook management through scripts
