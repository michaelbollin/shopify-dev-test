### Explanation

In Shopify, products have the following limitations:

1. Maximum of 3 options per product (e.g., Size, Color, Material)
2. Maximum of 100 variants per product
3. Each variant represents a unique combination of options

Example of a product with 3 options:
- Size: Small, Medium, Large
- Color: Red, Blue, Green
- Material: Cotton, Polyester

This could create up to 18 variants (3 √ó 3 √ó 2 = 18 combinations).
