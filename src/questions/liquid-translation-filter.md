### Explanation

The `t` filter is used for internationalization in Shopify themes. It translates content based on the active language.

Key points:
- Purpose:
  - Retrieves translations from locale files
  - Enables multi-language support
  - Maintains consistent translations
  - Supports nested translation keys

- Example usage:
```liquid
<!-- With HTML -->
<button>{{ 'products.product.add_to_cart' | t }}</button>

```

- How it works:
  1. Takes a translation key (e.g., 'products.product.add_to_cart')
  2. Checks the active language's locale file (e.g., fr.default.json)
  3. Returns the corresponding translation
  4. Falls back to default locale if translation missing

- Best practices:
  - Use consistent key naming
  - Keep translations organized by feature
  - Always provide default translations
  - Use dot notation for nesting
  - Keep HTML in templates, not translations
