### Explanation

Shopify Flow is the easiest way to create this type of automated workflow without coding.

Key points:
- Flow workflow components:
  1. Trigger: "Order paid"
  2. Conditions: 
     - Customer total spent > $500
     - Is not already tagged as VIP
  3. Actions:
     - Add VIP tag to customer

Benefits of using Flow:
- No coding required
- Real-time automation
- Can combine multiple conditions
- Can perform multiple actions

Other approaches would require:
- Custom app development or use 3rd party apps
- API integration management
- Webhook setup and maintenance
