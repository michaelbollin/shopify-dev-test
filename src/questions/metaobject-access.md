### Explanation

Products cannot have metaobjects directly attached to them. Instead, they can have metafields that reference metaobjects. Here's how to access a metaobject referenced by a product:

1. First, create and access a metafield that references the metaobject:
   ```liquid
   {% assign ingredients = product.metafields.custom.ingredients %}
   ```

2. Then access the metaobject's fields:
   ```liquid
   {% for ingredient in ingredients %}
     Name: {{ ingredient.fields.name.value }}
   {% endfor %}
   ```

Key points:
- Products have metafields, not metaobjects
- Metafields can reference metaobjects
