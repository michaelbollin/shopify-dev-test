### Explanation

Email/password login is only available through legacy customer templates:

```liquid
<!-- Legacy approach (still works but not recommended) -->
{% form 'customer_login' %}
  <!-- Email/password login still works here -->
{% endform %}

<!-- âœ… Modern approach - no direct email/password -->
<a href="{{ routes.account_url }}">
   Login with Shop or Social
</a>
```
