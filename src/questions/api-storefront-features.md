### Explanation

The Storefront API and REST Admin API have different capabilities based on their intended use:

```graphql
# Storefront API can:
- Read products, collections, and shop info
- Create/manage customer accounts
- Process orders and checkouts
- Handle cart operations

# REST Admin API can do all above PLUS:
- Create/update/delete products
- Manage inventory
- Access analytics
- Configure shop settings
- Manage staff accounts
```

Key points:
- Storefront API is read-heavy with limited write capabilities
- REST Admin API has full CRUD capabilities
- Storefront API focuses on customer-facing operations
- REST Admin API includes store management features
- Security determines available features
