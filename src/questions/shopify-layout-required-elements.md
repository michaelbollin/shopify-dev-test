### Explanation

Every Shopify layout file (like `theme.liquid`) must include two specific Liquid tags in the correct locations:

1. `{{ content_for_header }}` must be in the `<head>`:
   - Injects required Shopify scripts
   - Includes Google Analytics
   - Adds Shopify analytics
   - Loads app scripts
   - Required for theme validation

2. `{{ content_for_layout }}` must be in the `<body>`:
   - Outputs content from other templates
   - Renders page-specific content
   - Displays sections and blocks
   - Required for theme validation

Example of a minimal valid layout:
```liquid
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    {{ content_for_header }}
  </head>
  <body>
    {{ content_for_layout }}
  </body>
</html>
```

Without these tags in the correct locations, Shopify will not validate the theme.
