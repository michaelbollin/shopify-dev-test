### Explanation

As of September 10, 2024, Shopify implemented important updates to their webhook retry mechanism:

Key points:
- Webhooks are retried a total of 8 times over a 4-hour period
- Retried webhooks maintain the original payload from when they were first triggered
- The `X-Shopify-Triggered-At` header can be used to check if payload is stale
- Webhook retries will continue to use the original subscription address
