### Explanation

The `{% sections 'header-group' %}` tag is used to render a group of related sections in Shopify themes:

Key points:
- Section groups allow multiple sections to be managed together
- Different from `{% section %}` which renders a single section
- Common use cases:
  - Header components (announcement bars, menus, logos)
  - Footer sections
  - Related content blocks
- Benefits:
  - Better organization in theme editor
  - Reusable across templates
  - Maintains relationships between sections

Example section group structure:
```liquid
{% sections 'header-group' %}
<!-- Could render: -->
<!-- - Announcement bar section -->
<!-- - Navigation menu section -->
<!-- - Header logo section -->
```
