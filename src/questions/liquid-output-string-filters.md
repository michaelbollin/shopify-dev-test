### Explanation

Let's break down the code execution step by step:

1. Initial assignment:
   - `text = "hello WORLD"`

2. First filter - `capitalize`:
   - Capitalizes first letter, leaves rest unchanged
   - Result: "Hello WORLD"

3. Second filter - `replace`:
   - Replaces "WORLD" with "Everyone"
   - Result: "Hello Everyone"

Key points:
- Filters are applied from left to right
- `capitalize` only affects the first character
- `replace` is case-sensitive
- Multiple filters can be chained using pipe character `|`
